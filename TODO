//some points that may be thought over
1.when server violating the rule,instead of keep sending empty bodies and
  waiting for expected behaviour forever,(after a fixed number of waiting,
  we shd terminate the session) [never observed such behaviour]
2.keeping session establishment seperate i.e. analysis starts after all 
  the sessions are established[not a big issue i suppose,so not doing that 
  for the timebeing].
