[A] 	Introduction: It is a tool to stress test a bosh server on one hand 
	while on the other it can be used to just find latency in service at 
	a desired remote location.First of all it tries to authenticate 
	multiple clients simultaneously with the xmpp server each going 
	through following steps:
		a: bosh session creation
		b: SASL authentication using PLAIN mechanism
		c: stream restart
		d: resource binding
		e: session binding
	After successful completion of above steps user gets online(has an 
	established session with corresponding xmpp server).Now it can be 
	used in two different modes(1.Bombarding mode 2.normal mode).In 
	bombarding mode each of the above clients start sending sample 
	messages to themselves via bosh.As soon as they receive previously 
	sent message,they send another self-destined message.All the clients 
	keep doing this for a predefined time simultaneously and the response 
	times are recorded for analysis.In normal mode each of the above 
	established clients send messages to themselves in a longer interval
	(say every 30 seconds).So now instead of bombarding the server we can 
	find the average response time a normal user expects.


[B] 	Loglevels(in order):
		FATAL:	not used
		ERROR:	displays error messages
		DATA:	displays statistics
		INFO:	informs about important events
		DEBUG:	prints each packet sent and received


[C]	Statistics interpretation:[each of the following is recorded since 
	the last statistics printed]
		total:			total no. of http responses received by application
		nEstablished:		total number of established clients
		meanTL:			mean timelag over all the received messages
		maxTL:			max timelag over all the received messages
		sentperclient:		number of messages sent per client on average
		receivedperclient:	number of messages received per client on average
		Error%:			percentage of messages received with timelag greater 
						than a predefined threshold time 


[D] Command line options interpretation:
	
	Usage:

	The BOSH service endpoint (default: http://localhost:5280/http-bind/)
	    --endpoint
	The route attribute to use for connection with xmpp(default: <empty>)
	    --route
	The number of sessions(clients) to open (default: 1)
	    --nsess
	The Loglevel you want (default: INFO)
	    --logging
	which clients you want to create(default: 1)
	    --start
	Upper limit of acceptable response time(time lag) in seconds(default: 7)
	    --timeout
	mode in which clients operate (1.Bombarding 2.Normal mode)(default: 1)
	    --mode
	interval in seconds between two consecutive messages in normal mode(default: 5)
	    --interval
	statistics logging interval in seconds(default: 60)
	    --datainterval
	terminate the program after this time in minutes(default: 20)
	    --terminate
	Help. This message.
	    --help


[E] Quick Start:

    [1] To run, type:
    $ node <path-to-project>/boshclient.js <requisite arguments>

    [2] For options, type:
    $ node <path-to-project>/boshclient.js --help

    [3] For a more complex setup, see the file boshclient.js[function main() in particular]

[F] Directions: 
	[1]:	while creating a number of clients it may be convenient to use the usernames like 
		(user1@example.com,user2@example.com,user3@example.com etc.) having same or 
		logically related passwords(you know what i mean by logically related :P).you can 
		set the credentials to login in file boshclient.js(function start_test() in particular).
	[2]:	if you want to run multiple instances of this program each logging in a different set 
		of users, you can use 'start' attribute in the command line to set that(program will 
		login user<start>@example.com to user<start+nsess-1>@example.com users by default).
	[3]:	your xmpp server or bosh server might be configured to avoid being bombarded by any 
		client beyond a threshold no. of messages per unit time.So keep the configuration as 
		required while using the program in the bombarding mode.
